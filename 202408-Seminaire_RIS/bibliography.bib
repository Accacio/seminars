  abstract        = "We wish to develop interactive agents that can communicate
                  with humans to collaboratively solve tasks in grounded
                  scenarios. Since computer games allow us to simulate such
                  tasks without the need for physical robots, we define a
                  Minecraft-based collaborative building task in which one
                  player (A, the Architect) is shown a target structure and
                  needs to instruct the other player (B, the Builder) to build
                  this structure. Both players interact via a chat interface. A
                  can observe B but cannot place blocks. We present the
                  Minecraft Dialogue Corpus, a collection of 509 conversations
                  and game logs. As a first step towards our goal of developing
                  fully interactive agents for this task, we consider the
                  subtask of Architect utterance generation, and show how
                  challenging it is.",
